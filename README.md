ABSTRACT:
Gait analysis has traditionally been carried out in a laboratory environment using
expensive equipment, but, recently, Gait analysis using wearable sensors is an
inexpensive, convenient, and efficient manner of providing useful information for
multiple health-related applications. The gait analysis using wearable sensors provided
quantitative and repeatable results over extended time periods with low cost and good
portability, showing better prospects and making great progress.
Many sensors in wearable devices can help to record data of walking and running, the
Inertial measurement units (IMU) are sensors combining accelerometer and
gyroscopes to measure linear acceleration and angular velocity of the body to which it
is attached. The IMU helps to extract the gait pattern of the patient with more
accuracy. Impaired walking and locomotion are common resulting from injuries,
degenerative pathologies, musculoskeletal disorders, and various neurological
damages. Daily tracking and gait analysis are convenient and efficient approaches for
monitoring human walking, where concreate and rich data can be obtained for
examining our posture control mechanism during body movement and providing
enhanced diagnosis and treatment plan.

Project Report: MPU6050 Sensor Integration with Arduino IDE

Step 1: Arduino IDE Installation
Begin the project by installing the latest version of the Arduino IDE from the official website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Step 2: MPU6050 Library Installation
Open the Arduino IDE after installation.
Navigate to the Library Manager by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...
Search for "MPU6050" in the Library Manager.
Select the MPU6050 library from the list and click "Install."
Step 3: Arduino Program Development
Write the Arduino program to interface with the MPU6050 sensor. Save the program with an INO extension in the project files.

Step 4: Hardware Setup
Connect the Arduino board to the laptop or desktop. Ensure that the IMU MPU6050 sensor is properly connected to the Arduino board.

Step 5: Program Execution
Upload the previously written program to the Arduino board.
Check whether the baud rate in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor matches the baud rate specified in the program.
Step 6: Serial Plotter Configuration
Open the Serial Plotter tool in the Arduino IDE to monitor the frequency pattern output from the MPU6050 sensor in real-time.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully integrated the MPU6050 sensor with the Arduino IDE, developed and executed a program, and monitored the sensor output using the Serial Plotter tool. This comprehensive approach ensures a seamless setup and evaluation of the MPU6050 sensor's functionality.
